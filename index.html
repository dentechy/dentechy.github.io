          <strong>Dennis Feliciano</strong> is very passionate about nutrition, fitness and technology. Over the years, he became very knowledgeable in all three. In college he studied biochemistry, learning the fundamentals of just how the body processes food, down to a molecular level. While in college, he also studied and passed a certification examination to become an ACSM certified personal trainer, acquiring useful knowledge along the way on individualized fitness programs and coaching strategies. In grad school, he learned even more about the biochemical aspects of nutrition, such as the metabolic changes that occur during the postprandial state.</p>

        <p>The journey with technology though, began several years ago when he first installed Linux on an old Sony Vaio laptop. Over the years, he would experiment with the command line and eventually enroll in an online course tailored towards Linux system administration. That course provided even more valuable information on managing his own Linux systems, but doing everything strictly through the command line, even editing files through vim. His current Linux systems include a raspberry pi configured as an offsite backup in CT and another that is used as a local file server.</p>

        <p>The progression to web development was only natural from there. He has since enrolled in a full stack web development program, starting with the basics in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and moving to more advanced concepts such as Node.js, Express, mongodb and React. Below is a summary of the projects he has developed thus far. Enjoy!</p>

      <h2 id="file-server">Raspberry Pi File Server Tutorial</h2>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
      <p id="project-1-description">One of the first projects Dennis created directly involved his passion for Linux. Essentially a wireframe website was created using HTML and CSS, with an original article explaining step by step how to create a raspberry pi file server, all from the command line. The main prerequisites for following this tutorial are the hardware itself (a raspberry pi, hard drive and network) and access to the terminal from within the raspberry pi.</p>
      <p>When this file server is setup properly, it is able to share files with most major operating systems, including Windows, mac OS, Linux, Android and iOS. Content such as movies can also be streamed over the local network. View tutorial <a href="https://dentechy.github.io/Raspberry-Pi-File-Server-Tutorial/">here</a></p>

      <h2 id="file-server">CLI Digital Store</h2>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
      <p id="project-2-description">Another project that Dennis worked on was a command line app using node.js and MySQL database. This app once installed on the user's machine, works by first presenting the user the store inventory. Each item has an associated department, price and stock. When the user decides to "purchase" an item, they are presented with the total price (depending on amount requested) and the inventory is updated accordingly. </p>
      <p>Note that when the user requests to buy more than the available inventory, the app will throw an error message. Github <a href="https://github.com/dentechy/database-store">repo</a> contains detailed instructions on how to set up the CLI app.</p>

      <h2 id="wine-movies">WineMovieSearch</h2>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p id="project-3-description">In collaboration with the developers on his team, a web app was created that takes in user input and returns a silly wine related gif as the page "loads". This gif disappears, and is replaced by the requested movie information in the form of a movie poster, short plot summary and YouTube trailer. Dennis was primarily in charge of developing the JavaScript backend that returns data that the user requests, using OMDB, Giphy and YouTube APIs and grabbing information from JSON objects returned from AJAX calls. </p>
